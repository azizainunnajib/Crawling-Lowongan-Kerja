auto_inclusion,"505,134","Pelayanan,Layanan Pelanggan",820,Citigroup Inc.,false,"<div><div><br /><strong>How did you begin a career in customer service?</strong><br /><br /><p>My journey with customer service began early in my work career when I used to work for the phone banking division of Citi, where providing the highest level of care to problem solve for customers was the top priority. It meant I was talking to very happy customers, upset customers, frustrated customers, etc. What I loved the most was solving customers’ issues smoothly and leaving them satisfied or even happier than when then originally called. I’m thankful I got an opportunity to make customers feel valued – irrespective of the situation.</p><br /><strong>What does your day-to-day job entail and what do you like most about it?</strong><br /><br /><p>On a typical workday, I am responsible for overseeing a team that provides a comprehensive client service. The primary focus is on enhanced service excellence to Citibank customers across client segments and channels of delivery, and seamless execution of retail banking solutions that are within a controlled environment. Primary responsibility includes managing the level of service quality to ensure high-quality customer satisfaction in all aspects of retail branch banking processes &amp; procedures.</p><br /><strong>What do you enjoy most about your role?</strong><br /><br /><p>I love it when you take an unhappy customer who might be at the point of giving up and turn him/her around to a happy customer that is ready to give you another chance. I enjoy the people I work with. It is a fun and friendly atmosphere and I actually look forward to going to work every morning.</p><br /><strong>What skill set does someone working in this kind of area need?</strong><br /><br /><ul><br /><li>Patience</li><br /><li>Listening</li><br /><li>Attentiveness</li><br /><li>Clear communication skills</li><br /><li>Knowledge of the product</li><br /><li>Ability to use positive language</li><br /><li>Time management skills.</li><br /><li>Ability to read customers</li><br /><li>Goal oriented focus</li><br /><li>Persuasion skills</li><br /><li>Willingness to learn</li><br /><li>Most importantly - Empathy</li><br /></ul><br /><strong>What advice would you give to someone looking to break into a career in Customer Service?</strong><br /><br /><p>Today’s competitive environment revolves around the “customer,” where customer is the king and choices are many. Everyone today is selling something – product, service, idea, etc. However the key differentiating factor is how you handle the customer and the level of service that is provided. Inability to provide utmost satisfaction to the customer cannot lead to a long association with the products that the franchise has to offer.</p><br /><p>If you enjoy working with people and thrive on making others happy, a career in customer service could be exactly what you need to fulfill your ambitions. There are customer service jobs available in almost every industry. With the right skill set and the desire to help people, you’ll find a variety of different job options to consider. You’ll also have the opportunity for job growth and will be able to move up the career ladder.</p><br /><strong>Where can a career at Citi take you?</strong><br /><br /><p>The customer service career pathway prepares you for a variety of positions that involve problem solving, meeting the needs of clients, and working with large diversified teams. Beyond the opportunities for personal growth, the road to and through customer service can lead to career advancement.</p><br /><p>Some next-step roles may include:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Management/Supervisory roles</li><br /><li>Product Development/Marketing Department</li><br /><li>Sales Positions</li><br /><li>Training &amp; Development</li><br /><li>Compliance</li><br /></ul><br /><strong>What makes Citi a great place to work?</strong><br /><br /><p>I believe people and a firm's culture are very important in one's decision to work at a certain company. I think I would say that what makes Citi really unique is its diversity and the ability for employees to collaborate and innovate. Our leadership is exceptional and the connection with all employees in the organization across levels is something we admire. We have 200 years of legacy, experience, and brand value that no other company can offer.</p><br /><strong>What is the culture like at Citi?</strong><br /><br /><p>A truly strong culture that offers mutual support, promotes trust, rewards employees' efforts, and ensures that employees know their work is meaningful. This is clearly visible in our mission to “serve as a trusted partner to our clients by responsibly providing financial services that enable growth and economic progress” and how all employees are aligned to this.</p><br /></div></div>-",,1031197626,false,false,Universal Service Banker,https://www.jobstreet.co.id/id/job/universal-service-banker-1031197626?token=0~5084f7e2-c00d-4553-9cbe-b144e305258d&sectionRank=49&jobId=jobstreet-id-job-1031197626,Jakarta Raya,2022-04-14T15:39:31Z,,3 minutes ago,,,monthly,,,

auto_inclusion,"505,134","Pelayanan,Layanan Pelanggan",820,Citigroup Inc.,false,"<div><div><br /><strong>How does your role/department impact the larger organization?</strong><br /><br /><p>My department is responsible for governance of the Managers Control Assessment process for all AML monitoring and investigations functions, which is the medium mechanism for the company to execute their controls. Our coverage is global.</p><br /><strong>How did you begin a career in Compliance/AML?</strong><br /><br /><p>I started as an AML analyst. I am native Turkish and, at that time, CSC Poland was looking for Turkish speakers for a migration on AML monitoring from Turkey to Poland.</p><br /><strong>What does your day-to-day job entail and what do you like most about it?</strong><br /><br /><p>My current position is a self-contributor role. On my day-to-day work, I need to ensure that all required reports are generated on time and shared with the senior management. Since our program is the main control program within Citi, it is critical that reports are produced correctly and delivered in timely manner.</p><br /><strong>What do you enjoy most about your role?</strong><br /><br /><p>I like to speak with different people all around the globe. Moreover, my role allows me to have insight into all processes in functions supported by us. The exposure to the whole AML environment gives me a helicopter view of the AML Department. At the same time I have the opportunity to see the details of all teams and processes, which allows me to gain a greater knowledge and perspective on AML in Citi.</p><br /><strong>What skill set does someone working in this kind of area need?</strong><br /><br /><p>You need to have analytical skills. You need to be open and have a transparent approach. Since you are going to be in contact with several people all around the globe, you need to be patient. It would be beneficial to be self-initiator and persistent. Sense of ownership is valuable as well; any idea, even the best, can be forgotten if not driven with confidence.</p><br /><strong>What advice would you give to someone looking to break into a career in AML?</strong><br /><br /><p>Be focused, be analytical, be innovative, and continue challenging during your investigations. Own your initiatives and don’t limit yourself. Try to understand and learn more about the organization while improving your network among different departments.</p><br /><strong>Where can a career at Citi take you?</strong><br /><br /><p>I want to give an example here to show you the scale of the opportunity. My Belarusian direct report moved to Poland to study and then got employed by Citi as an AML analyst. He moved forward in his career and he got a position in the AML Quality Assurance team. He was sent to Geneva for 3 months assignment to support the process. He was very successful, hence was offered a position there. That meant he was to be the very first QA team member there. After two successful years in that position, he moved to a compliance role with a promotion.</p><br /><strong>What makes Citi a good place to work?</strong><br /><br /><p>Citi is good place to work due to several reasons. It is truly a multi-cultural organization. Regardless of your position, you are always in touch with people from all around the world. That leads us to the second reason. Citi is truly a global organization, having locations and branches in many countries. Having those two major properties, Citi is one of the best employers, offering almost limitless development opportunities to its employees.</p><br /><p>This is just a small example from the huge Citi world; therefore, Citi is not only a good, but a great place to work!</p><br /><strong>Do you take part in any volunteering, special programs, or leadership development opportunities and/or participate in any Employee Networks?</strong><br /><br /><p>It is pivotal and highly encouraged to any Citi employee to be active and use opportunities provided by Citi. Personally, I have actively participated in the volunteering week for the last 5 years. I had the chance to attend several self-development courses and special programs.</p><br /><p>I have completed many Citi course trainings offered to me. I was also selected in 2016 to participate in I Lead – AVP program, which is a special curriculum for high-performance AVPs from various business functions who are gathered and given assignments to real applicability projects with the task of proposing solutions.</p><br /><p>I co-chair Citi Pride Network for CSC Poland. At the moment of filling this questionnaire, our network is still under establishment, but surely not for much longer! I also take active roles in Poland disABILITY and Poland Multicultural employee networks.</p><br /></div></div>-",,1031266971,false,false,Consumer KYC AML Analyst,https://www.jobstreet.co.id/id/job/consumer-kyc-aml-analyst-1031266971?token=0~524ba0b2-05b2-4c9d-a0a5-f1d62b5e5767&sectionRank=81&jobId=jobstreet-id-job-1031266971,Jakarta Raya,2022-04-14T15:38:36Z,,5 minutes ago,,,monthly,,,
